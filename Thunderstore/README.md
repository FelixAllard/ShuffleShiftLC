## Scp File
SCP 1507 : EUCLID 

Item #: SCP-1507

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-1507 are to be housed within Site-77's Wilderness Observation Deck. In the event that Foundation staff need to interact with SCP-1507, PoI-1507 is to accompany them into the chamber. Staff must be a minimum of 5 meters away of PoI-1507 when in the presence of SCP-1507.

Any requests PoI-1507 has in relation to SCP-1507 are to be reviewed by the current research head. PoI-1507 is allowed to and encouraged to have daily interactions with SCP-1507.

Description: SCP-1507 is the collective designation given to thirty plastic lawn flamingos of unknown make or manufacturer. Instances of SCP-1507 bear no notable behavioral differences from the average American Flamingo, save for an increase in territorial behavior and lack of vocalization. Said behavior often results in attacks targeted towards Foundation staff. The only individual known to circumvent their behaviors is PoI-1507, otherwise known as Leroy Day.

Hume level testing performed on PoI-1507 suggest reality bending abilities, though all conversations with him have come back as unclear of his awareness of his abilities.

Addendum.1507.A: Following are phone logs recovered from PoI-1507's phone following the acquisition of SCP-1507. Due to a lack of compliance and resources an interview was unable to be taken from PoI-1507.

## Behaviour
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal spoiler!</summary>
here are the 2 monsters added :
- SCP 1507 Alpha
  - The flamingo with the glasses is the alpha flamingo. He will walk around the facility and when looked at will stop moving.
  - When moving, he will spawn flamingo instances SCP 1507 which will be unmoving. Those instances are passive and won't attack the player just yet.
  - When the alpha is angry after a player, all the flamingo + the alpha will start chasing that player in a really goofy way. They may do 5 damage, but their sheer number will kill you. This mod is optimised so that your game can easily handle a lot of those flamingo. I mean, a *lot*
- SCP 1507 Instances
  - Scp 1507 instances will spawn with a random hat, (It does not affect gameplay).
  - They will be unmoving and will act as the eyes of the alpha. The action you take before a flamingo are seen by the alpha.
  - Once the alpha is angry at a player, they will all go toward that player and try to peck him.
  - Once the alpha is dead, they will become on rampage and always attack the nearest player


What makes them angry?
- Hitting a SCP 1507 instances ( + 5 anger)
- Hitting the Alpha ( +20 anger )
- Looking at them to much ( +2 anger )
- Using the AirHorn next to them ( +1 anger )
- Having a shotgun while looking at them ( +9 anger 
- Having a knife while looking at them ( +5 anger )
- Having a shovel while looking at them ( +5 anger )

What calms them?
- Dancing next to them ( -1 anger )

AT 10 anger points, the herd will be angry at you. If you got any ideas for new ways, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/H6ZEmpXwjZ) server and tell us!
