# Shuffle Shift
### Description
The Lobby Shuffle Mod is a Unity script that randomly swaps the positions and rotations of all players in a lobby.
This can add an element of surprise and fun to your game by ensuring that no player remains in their initial position.
No more camping the ship! I made configurations so you can easily choose the interval at which the swap occurs and the chances for it happening.
This is just a really small project, and I might make extensions of it in this mod or another, i don't know yet. For updates on what I am doing, you can look at my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/TheWeavers). You don't need to subscribe and you will see all the updates :)
